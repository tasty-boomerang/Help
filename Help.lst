inputtab|Set the input file delimiter (press the Tab key for a tab delimiter) and set the correct header option. Add or delete an input column if you've already created rules for a file but the file has had an extra column added or an existing column removed. Click the re-order button on the far right to enable the dragging of columns up and down if the column position has changed within the input file
outputtab|Set the output file delimiter, set the correct header option or add an extra column to the passing output file. Click the re-order button on the far right to enable the dragging of columns up and down to change the column position within the passing output file. Select or deselect the columns for output one at a time or all at once
optiontabfilecontent|Choose the first option to see all of the input rows in the failure file or the second option to only see the rows that failed one or more rules 
optiontabfilelayout|Choose the first option to produce a failure file in the same format as the input file or the second option to produce a failure file in the same format as the passing file specified in the Output tab
optiontabfilecolumns|Choose which of the additional failure columns you wish to display in the failure file. The Failure Description is the system generated detailed failure reason, Failure Code is the user-defined code entered for each rule and Group Failure Code is the user-defined code for the highest level group where the code has been entered
optionprocessing|The first option ensures that all rows matching the Input Configuration will be processed for pass/fail and those rows not matching will show as a fail on the processing screen and in the failure file, with a failure description of “Row does not match schema”. Choosing the second option, if one of the rows doesn’t match the Input Configuration, then no processing will occur

description|This description will show on the main rules screen|description box on all rules

There are six predefined formats to choose from, but any other format can be typed if required. Milliseconds are not currently supported but can be ignored by using ".000"|date format selector
