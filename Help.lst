inputtab|Set the input file delimiter (press the Tab key for a tab delimiter) and set the correct header option. Add or delete an input column if you've already created rules for a file but the file has had an extra column added or an existing column removed. Click the re-order button on the far right to enable the dragging of columns up and down if the column position has changed within the input file
outputtab|Set the output file delimiter, set the correct header option or add an extra column to the passing output file. Click the re-order button on the far right to enable the dragging of columns up and down to change the column position within the passing output file.

optionprocessing|The first option ensures that all rows matching the Input Configuration will be processed for pass/fail and those rows not matching will show as a fail on the processing screen and in the failure file, with a failure description of “Row does not match schema”. Choosing the second option, if one of the rows doesn’t match the Input Configuration, then no processing will occur
